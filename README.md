# Sorting
C program to demonstrate different sorting algorithms

# Background
There are many different kinds of sorting algorithms used in programming. These different algorithms all produce the same results but do so with different efficiencies. The efficiency of a sorting algorithm depends on many factors including how the elements in the list/array are arranged and the total number of elements to sort. For example, an insertion sorting alogrithm will generally perform slower than a merge algorithm on a list/array that has been sorted in reverse order.

# Purpose
The purpose of this programm is to get a better understanding of how different sorting algorithms work. By implementing these algorithms, one will hope to gain a better understanding of how and why some algorithms perform better than others.
